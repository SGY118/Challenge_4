# Overview of the school district analysis
The school board has asked us to analyze student data which showed evidence of academic dishonesty. We were informed from the school that the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders were altered. The school wants to uphold state testing standards therefore turned us for help. We wanted to replace the math and reading scores with NaNs and keep the rest of the data the same. We therefore need to build models in order to help make changes accordingly by the school's instructions.
